# Organization of this directory

This directory holds other directories which are for individual pickaxe runs so data can stay somewhat organized. Each sub-directory's name is the date and time it was created

Each sub-directory has a python file which is used to actually run pickaxe object, a .pik file of the saved pickaxe object throughout the run, as well as a .txt file holding some information about the specific pickaxe run. Any figures and other datasets from the pickaxe object will be saved in the directory

The file `make_new_dir.sh` will create a new directory with the proper name and with necessary file templates.
